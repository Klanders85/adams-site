        <h2>Company History</h2>
        <p>Metro Air &amp; Heat has been family owned and operated company for over 35 years. Proudly serving Tarrant County. Unlike most "national" corporations, you will be talking directly to the sole owners of the company, and deal with us each and every time. That is one of the many reason why service is more valuable to us than profit.The company was founded by Aaron Weeks 1978. Once he handed over the reigns to his son Tim, the company flourished. Fast foward to today where we have Adam Olsen (Tim&rsquo;s nephew), who has been a huge part of the company for over 7 years now and is about to take the reigns from his uncle and grow the company even further. </p>

        <h2>About the Team</h2>
        <p>When Adam is not managing the company, in his spare time he is a devoted family man first. In the winter months, he is an avid fisherman, fantasy football champion, and a die-hard Dallas Cowboys fan (win or lose...).</p>
        <p>
          Tim Weeks is loving father, proud grandfather and is outdoor enthusiast. Any opportunity he gets during the winter to go hunting or fishing, you will find him there. But in all reality, Metro Air &amp; Heat is his life. He has given everything to making this company where it is today and is excited to see where his nephew takes it.
